== What is it?

A comprehensive library for validating JWT tokens in multi-issuer environments.
The core idea is to leverage offline-validation of JWT tokens.

Current version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT

Key features include:

* Multi-issuer support for handling tokens from different identity providers
* Automatic JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) key management and rotation, with JWKS URI configurable directly or via OpenID Connect (OIDC) Discovery.
* Type-safe token parsing and validation
* Scope-based authorization support
* Protection against common JWT attacks
* Configurable security settings
* Tested compatibility with Keycloak as identity provider

[NOTE]
====
This library is not meant as a replacement for a full-fledged OAuth2 or OpenID Connect library.
Therefore it will never be capable of creating tokens itself.
====

=== Maven Coordinates

[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
        <groupId>de.cuioss.jwt</groupId>
        <artifactId>cui-jwt-validation</artifactId>
    </dependency>
----

==== Runtime Dependencies

This library requires an implementation of the `jakarta.json-api` to be present at runtime.
The library itself includes the API as a provided dependency, but you need to provide an implementation such as Eclipse Parsson:

[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.eclipse.parsson</groupId>
        <artifactId>parsson</artifactId>
        <version>1.1.1</version> <!-- Use appropriate version -->
    </dependency>
----

Alternatively, you can use any other Jakarta JSON API implementation.

==== Test Artifact

The library also provides a test artifact with utilities for testing JWT validation in your applications:

[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
        <groupId>de.cuioss.jwt</groupId>
        <artifactId>cui-jwt-validation</artifactId>
        <classifier>test</classifier>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
----

This artifact contains utility classes for creating and manipulating JWT tokens for testing purposes.
See the link:cui-jwt/UnitTesting.adoc[Test Utilities Documentation] for more details.

== Architecture Overview

image::doc/plantuml/component-overview.png[Component Overview]

The library is designed around a pipeline architecture for token validation, with each component handling a specific aspect of the validation process. The main components are:

* *TokenValidator*: The primary entry point for all token operations
* *Token Validation Pipeline*: A series of validators for headers, signatures, and claims
* *Multi-Issuer Support*: Configuration for multiple identity providers
* *Key Management*: Handling of cryptographic keys for token validation, including discovery of JWKS URI via OIDC.

For detailed information about the architecture and components, see the link:doc/specification/technical-components.adoc[Technical Components] documentation.
The library also supports configuration of JWKS URI via link:doc/specification/well-known.adoc[OpenID Connect Discovery], simplifying setup in compatible environments.

== Getting Started

To start using the library, you'll need to:

1. Add the Maven dependency to your project
2. Configure one or more issuers
3. Create a TokenValidator instance
4. Use the validator to validate tokens

Here's a minimal example:

[source,java]
----
// Create issuer configuration
IssuerConfig issuerConfig = IssuerConfig.builder()
        .issuer("https://your-issuer.com")
        .httpJwksLoaderConfig(httpJwksLoaderConfig)
        .build();

// Create validator
TokenValidator validator = new TokenValidator(issuerConfig);

// Validate token
// This will throw TokenValidationException if validation fails
AccessTokenContent accessToken = validator.createAccessToken(tokenString);

// For configuration using OIDC Discovery, see the Usage Guide.
----

For more detailed examples and best practices, see the link:cui-jwt/README.adoc[Usage Guide].
