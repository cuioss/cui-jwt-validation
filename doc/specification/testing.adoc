== Compliance with CUI Testing Standards

This section outlines how the JWT Token Validation library testing should comply with the CUI Testing Standards:

* https://github.com/cuioss/cui-llm-rules/blob/main/standards/testing/core-standards.adoc[CUI Testing Core Standards]
* https://github.com/cuioss/cui-llm-rules/blob/main/standards/testing/quality-standards.adoc[CUI Quality Standards and Testing Framework]

=== Summary of CUI Testing Core Standards

The CUI Testing Core Standards define the following key principles:

==== Core Testing Principles
* *Test Coverage*: All public methods must have unit tests, with at least 80% line coverage
* *Test Independence*: Tests must be independent, not rely on execution order, and clean up after themselves
* *Test Clarity*: Tests should follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern and clearly describe what is being tested
* *Test Maintenance*: Tests must be maintained alongside production code and fixed promptly when failing

==== Test Types
* *Unit Tests*: Focus on testing a single unit of code in isolation with mocked dependencies
* *Integration Tests*: Test interaction between components, may use real dependencies
* *System Tests*: Test the entire system as a whole, verifying end-to-end functionality

==== Best Practices
* *Test Organization*: Group related tests, use descriptive names, follow consistent conventions
* *Test Data*: Use meaningful test data, avoid hardcoded values, consider edge cases
* *Assertions*: Use specific assertions with meaningful error messages

=== Summary of CUI Quality Standards and Testing Framework

The CUI Quality Standards and Testing Framework defines:

==== Core Testing Standards
* *Test Structure*: Follow AAA pattern, one logical assertion per test, clear naming
* *Coverage Requirements*: Minimum 80% line and branch coverage, critical paths must have 100% coverage
* *Testing Tools*: Use JUnit 5, CUI testing utilities (cui-test-generator, cui-test-value-objects, etc.)

==== Quality Verification
* *Quality Analysis Tools*: SonarCloud, JUnit, mutation testing, code reviews
* *Quality Metrics*: Code coverage, duplication, complexity, issue density, technical debt
* *Parameterized Tests Best Practices*: Minimum 3 test cases, descriptive method names, clear documentation
* *Performance*: Fast test execution, efficient resource usage, parallel execution where possible
* *Review Process*: Regular reviews after major features, before PRs, during code review

==== Success Criteria
* *Test Coverage*: All coverage requirements met, critical paths fully covered
* *Quality Analysis*: All quality gates passed, new issues addressed
* *Security*: No critical vulnerabilities, security hotspots reviewed

=== Integration Testing with TestContainers
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-12.3[CUI-JWT-12.3: Integration Testing]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

Integration tests have been implemented to verify compatibility with Keycloak as an identity provider (IDP) using TestContainers.

The following test class implements integration tests with Keycloak:

* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/TokenKeycloakITTest.java[TokenKeycloakITTest.java] - Integration tests with Keycloak

These tests cover:

The implementation uses:

* Official Keycloak TestContainer: https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/keycloak/
* CUI Keycloak Integration: `de.cuioss.test:cui-test-keycloak-integration` (Maven dependency)

The `KeycloakITBase` class from the `cui-test-keycloak-integration` library provides automatic setup and teardown of a Keycloak container, methods to get the Keycloak URLs, test realm and user configuration, and helper methods for token requests and validation.

Refer to the implementation and associated JavaDoc for detailed behavior.

=== Security Testing
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8[CUI-JWT-8: Security]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

Comprehensive security testing has been implemented to verify the security aspects of the JWT Token Validation library.

For detailed information about security testing, including test classes, test coverage, and specific security tests like Key Disclosure Vulnerability Tests and Token Cracking Resistance Tests, please refer to the link:security.adoc[Security] document, specifically the "Security Testing Specifications" section.

=== Performance Testing
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-9[CUI-JWT-9: Performance]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

Performance testing has been implemented to verify that the JWT Token Validation library meets the performance requirements.

The following test classes implement performance testing:

* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/TokenValidatorPerformanceTest.java[TokenValidatorPerformanceTest.java] - Tests for token parsing and validation performance
* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/jwks/http/HttpJwksLoaderPerformanceTest.java[HttpJwksLoaderPerformanceTest.java] - Tests for JWKS loading and key retrieval performance

1. Token parsing performance for different token types
2. Concurrent token validation performance
3. Mixed token type processing performance
4. JWKS loading and caching performance
5. Concurrent key retrieval performance
6. Performance statistics collection and analysis

The implementation uses concurrent testing to simulate real-world load scenarios and measures:

1. Throughput (tokens processed per second)
2. Average processing time per token/key retrieval
3. Success rate under load
4. Performance under different concurrency levels
5. Cache efficiency for JWKS loading

=== Logging Tests
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-7[CUI-JWT-7: Logging]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

Comprehensive logging tests have been implemented to verify that the JWT Token Validation library logs appropriate information at the correct log levels.

The following test classes implement these logging tests:

* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/TokenValidatorTest.java[TokenValidatorTest.java] - Contains a nested class `TokenLoggingTests` with tests for token-related logging
* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/pipeline/TokenClaimValidatorTest.java[TokenClaimValidatorTest.java] - Contains tests that verify logging for claim validation
* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/pipeline/TokenSignatureValidatorTest.java[TokenSignatureValidatorTest.java] - Contains tests that verify logging for signature validation

These tests cover:

1. **Success Scenario Logging Tests**:
   * Test logging of successful token validation
   * Test logging of successful key retrieval
   * Test logging of successful token creation

2. **Error Scenario Logging Tests**:
   * Test logging of token validation failures
   * Test logging of key retrieval failures
   * Test logging of token creation failures

The implementation follows CUI logging test requirements:

1. Uses `cui-test-juli-logger` for testing
2. Uses `de.cuioss.test.juli.TestLogLevel` for log levels
3. Provides test coverage for INFO/WARN/ERROR/FATAL logs
4. Follows LogAsserts guidelines:
   * First argument is TestLogLevel
   * Uses appropriate assertion methods:
     * assertLogMessagePresent: For exact matches
     * assertLogMessagePresentContaining: For partial matches
     * assertNoLogMessagePresent: For absence checks
5. Tests both successful and error scenarios
6. Uses LogRecord#resolveIdentifierString for message verification

==== Example Tests

The following test methods demonstrate the logging test approach:

* `shouldLogWarningWhenTokenIsEmpty()` - Tests that a warning is logged when an empty token is provided
* `shouldLogWarningWhenTokenFormatIsInvalid()` - Tests that a warning is logged when a token has an invalid format
* `shouldLogWarningWhenTokenValidationFails()` - Tests that a warning is logged when token validation fails
* `shouldLogWarningWhenTokenIsMissingClaims()` - Tests that a warning is logged when a token is missing required claims
* `shouldLogWarningWhenKeyIsNotFound()` - Tests that a warning is logged when a key is not found

These tests ensure that the library logs appropriate information at the correct log levels for both successful operations and error scenarios.

=== Vulnerability Scanning
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-12.4[CUI-JWT-12.4: Vulnerability Scanning]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

Vulnerability scanning has been implemented using GitHub Dependabot to regularly check for security vulnerabilities in dependencies.

For detailed information about dependency management and vulnerability scanning, please refer to the link:security.adoc[Security] document, specifically the "Dependency Management" section.

==== Fuzz Testing Implementation

Fuzz testing has been implemented using Generators from https://github.com/cuioss/cui-test-generator to generate a wide variety of test inputs for JWT tokens. This approach allows for comprehensive testing of the library's ability to handle various token formats, claims, and edge cases.

The following generator classes implement fuzz testing:

* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/test/generator/AccessTokenGenerator.java[AccessTokenGenerator] - Generates random but valid access tokens with varying claims
* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/test/generator/IDTokenGenerator.java[IDTokenGenerator] - Generates random but valid ID tokens with varying claims
* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/test/generator/ScopeGenerator.java[ScopeGenerator] - Generates random scopes for access tokens
* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/test/generator/RoleGenerator.java[RoleGenerator] - Generates random roles for access tokens

These generators are used in parameterized tests with the `@TypeGeneratorSource` annotation to perform fuzz testing. For example:

[source, java]
----
@DisplayName("3.3b: Reject access-validation with invalid signature")
@ParameterizedTest
@TypeGeneratorSource(value = AccessTokenGenerator.class, count = 50)
void shouldRejectAccessTokenWithInvalidSignature(String token) {
    // Tamper with the token using one of the tampering strategies
    String tamperedToken = JwtTokenTamperingUtil.tamperWithToken(token);

    // Verify that the tampered token is rejected
    var result = tokenValidator.createAccessToken(tamperedToken);
    assertFalse(result.isPresent(), "Token with invalid signature should be rejected");
}
----

This approach ensures that the library is tested against a wide range of inputs, helping to identify potential vulnerabilities that might not be discovered with traditional testing methods.

=== Compliance Testing
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-12.5[CUI-JWT-12.5: Compliance Testing]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

Compliance tests have been implemented to verify that the JWT Token Validation library adheres to the standards and best practices defined in various specifications.

The following test classes implement these compliance tests:

* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/RFC7519JWTComplianceTest.java[RFC7519JWTComplianceTest.java] - Tests compliance with the JWT specification defined in RFC 7519
* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/OpenIDConnectComplianceTest.java[OpenIDConnectComplianceTest.java] - Tests compliance with OpenID Connect Certification requirements
* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/OAuth2JWTBestPracticesComplianceTest.java[OAuth2JWTBestPracticesComplianceTest.java] - Tests compliance with OAuth 2.0 JWT Best Current Practices
* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/test/JwtTokenTamperingUtil.java[JwtTokenTamperingUtil.java] - Utility class for tampering with JWT tokens for testing purposes

These tests cover:

1. **RFC 7519 JWT Compliance**:
   * JWT format and structure validation
   * Registered claim names handling
   * Token validation rules
   * JWT claims set processing

2. **OpenID Connect Compliance**:
   * ID Token required and optional claims
   * Standard claims handling
   * Token validation according to OpenID Connect Core 1.0

3. **OAuth 2.0 JWT Best Practices Compliance**:
   * Audience validation
   * Issuer validation
   * Signature validation
   * Token lifetime validation
   * Token size limits

==== JWT Token Tampering Testing

The link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/test/JwtTokenTamperingUtil.java[JwtTokenTamperingUtil] class provides a comprehensive approach to testing JWT token signature tampering. This utility implements best practices for testing JWT signature tampering as documented in Test-Failure.adoc.

The class provides the following tampering strategies:

* **MODIFY_SIGNATURE_LAST_CHAR**: Modifies the last character of the signature
* **MODIFY_SIGNATURE_RANDOM_CHAR**: Modifies a random character in the signature
* **REMOVE_SIGNATURE**: Removes the signature entirely
* **ALGORITHM_NONE**: Changes the algorithm in the header to 'none'
* **ALGORITHM_DOWNGRADE**: Changes the algorithm in the header from RS256 to HS256
* **DIFFERENT_SIGNATURE**: Uses a completely different signature
* **INVALID_KID**: Changes the key ID (kid) in the header to an invalid value
* **REMOVE_KID**: Removes the key ID (kid) from the header

The utility is used in the OAuth2JWTBestPracticesComplianceTest class to verify that tokens with tampered signatures are properly rejected:

[source, java]
----
// In OAuth2JWTBestPracticesComplianceTest.SignatureValidationTests
@DisplayName("3.3b: Reject access-validation with invalid signature")
@ParameterizedTest
@TypeGeneratorSource(value = AccessTokenGenerator.class, count = 50)
void shouldRejectAccessTokenWithInvalidSignature(String token) {
    // Tamper with the token using one of the tampering strategies
    String tamperedToken = JwtTokenTamperingUtil.tamperWithToken(token);

    // Verify that the tampered token is rejected
    var result = tokenValidator.createAccessToken(tamperedToken);
    assertFalse(result.isPresent(), "Token with invalid signature should be rejected");
}
----

This approach ensures comprehensive testing of the library's ability to detect and reject tampered tokens, which is critical for security.

==== Test Class Naming Convention

Compliance test classes will follow this naming pattern:

`<Standard><Feature>ComplianceTest`

Where:
* `<Standard>` is the identifier of the standard or specification (e.g., RFC7519, OAuth2)
* `<Feature>` is the specific feature or aspect being tested (e.g., JWT, TokenValidation)

==== Requirement Referencing

Within each compliance test class, tests will include references to the specific requirements they verify through:

1. Class-level documentation that lists all requirements covered by the test class
2. Method-level documentation that specifies which requirement(s) each test method verifies
3. Assertions that include requirement identifiers in failure messages

This approach will ensure that:

1. Test classes are consistently named based on the standards they verify
2. Each test is clearly linked to the requirements it validates
3. It's easy to trace from requirements to tests and vice versa
4. Test failure messages provide context about which requirements are violated
