== Secure Token Handling on the Client

=== Token Storage

==== Recommendations

1. **Never store JWTs in local storage or session storage**
   * Local storage and session storage are accessible to JavaScript, making them vulnerable to XSS attacks
   * If an attacker can execute JavaScript in the context of your application, they can steal tokens

2. **Use HttpOnly cookies for token storage**
   * Set the `HttpOnly` flag to prevent JavaScript access to the cookie
   * Set the `Secure` flag to ensure the cookie is only sent over HTTPS
   * Set the `SameSite=strict` or `SameSite=lax` attribute to prevent CSRF attacks

3. **For SPAs, consider using refresh token rotation**
   * Store a short-lived access token in memory (not persistent storage)
   * Use a refresh token in an HttpOnly cookie for obtaining new access tokens
   * Implement refresh token rotation (invalidate previous refresh tokens when a new one is issued)

==== Implementation Example

```java
// Server-side code to set an HttpOnly cookie
response.setHeader("Set-Cookie", 
    "refresh_token=" + refreshToken + 
    "; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=strict; Path=/; Max-Age=86400");
```

=== Token Transmission

==== Recommendations

1. **Always use HTTPS for token transmission**
   * Never transmit tokens over unencrypted HTTP connections
   * Configure your server to use HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)

2. **Send tokens in the Authorization header**
   * Use the standard `Authorization: Bearer <token>` format
   * Avoid sending tokens in URL parameters where they can be captured in logs

3. **Implement proper CORS policies**
   * Restrict allowed origins to trusted domains
   * Do not use wildcard origins (`*`) for endpoints that handle sensitive data or authentication

==== Implementation Example

```java
// Client-side code to send a token in the Authorization header
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
    .uri(URI.create("https://api.example.com/resource"))
    .header("Authorization", "Bearer " + accessToken)
    .build();
```

=== Token Lifecycle Management

==== Recommendations

1. **Implement proper token revocation**
   * Have a mechanism to revoke tokens when users log out
   * Maintain a token blacklist for revoked tokens if immediate invalidation is needed
   * Consider using Redis or a similar high-performance store for token blacklists

2. **Use short token lifetimes**
   * Keep access token lifetimes short (5-15 minutes)
   * Use refresh tokens with longer lifetimes for obtaining new access tokens
   * Implement automatic token refresh in client applications

3. **Implement secure logout**
   * Clear tokens from memory
   * Revoke tokens on the server if possible
   * Clear any related cookies or storage

==== Implementation Example

```java
// Client-side logout function
function logout() {
    // Clear token from memory
    accessToken = null;
    
    // Call server-side logout endpoint to revoke tokens
    fetch('https://api.example.com/logout', {
        method: 'POST',
        credentials: 'include', // Include cookies for refresh token
    });
    
    // Redirect to login page
    window.location.href = '/login';
}
```

== Proper Library Configuration

=== Token Validation Settings

This section provides guidance on configuring the library for secure token validation. For details on the internal implementation of these validation mechanisms, see link:security-specifications.adoc#signature-validation[Signature Validation] and link:security-specifications.adoc#claims-validation[Claims Validation] in the Security Specifications document.

==== Recommendations

1. **Always validate token signatures**
   * Always use the library's validation methods, never decode tokens without validation
   * Ensure signature verification is mandatory in your application flow

2. **Enforce strict audience validation**
   * Configure the library to validate the `aud` claim
   * Set the expected audience to your application's client ID

3. **Enforce issuer validation**
   * Configure the library to validate the `iss` claim
   * Set the expected issuer to your trusted identity provider's URL

4. **Implement expiration and issuance time validation**
   * Validate the `exp` (expiration time) claim
   * Validate the `nbf` (not before) claim
   * Validate the `iat` (issued at) claim to prevent token reuse

==== Implementation Example

```java
// Example configuration using the library
TokenValidator validator = TokenValidator.builder()
    .issuerConfig(IssuerConfig.builder()
        .issuerUrl("https://idp.example.com")
        .expectedAudience("my-client-id")
        .expectedClientId("my-client-id")
        .build())
    .build();
```

=== Algorithm Configuration

This section provides guidance on securely configuring JWT algorithms. For detailed information on how the library prevents algorithm-based attacks, see link:security-specifications.adoc#none-algorithm-attack[None Algorithm Attack], link:security-specifications.adoc#trivial-secret[Trivial Secret], and link:security-specifications.adoc#algorithm-confusion[Algorithm Confusion] in the Security Specifications document.

==== Recommendations

1. **Use strong, asymmetric algorithms**
   * Prefer RS256, RS384, RS512, ES256, ES384, or ES512
   * Avoid using HS256, HS384, or HS512 as they require sharing of secrets

2. **Explicitly specify allowed algorithms**
   * Never allow the "none" algorithm
   * Explicitly specify which algorithms are allowed, don't rely on defaults
   * Prevent algorithm confusion attacks by strictly validating algorithm types

3. **Enforce consistent algorithm usage**
   * Configure your application to expect tokens signed with a specific algorithm
   * Reject tokens that use unexpected algorithms, even if they validate

==== Implementation Example

```java
// Example configuration specifying allowed algorithms
TokenValidator validator = TokenValidator.builder()
    .algorithmPreferences(AlgorithmPreferences.builder()
        .allowedAlgorithms(List.of("RS256"))
        .build())
    .build();
```

== Key Management Best Practices

=== Key Storage and Protection

This section provides guidance on secure key management practices. For information on how the library implements key management internally, see link:security-specifications.adoc#key-management[Key Management] in the Security Specifications document.

==== Recommendations

1. **Protect private keys at all costs**
   * Store private keys in secure key management services (AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
   * Never store private keys in code, configuration files, or source control
   * Use encryption for any private key storage

2. **Implement proper key access controls**
   * Restrict access to keys based on the principle of least privilege
   * Use IAM roles and policies to control access to key management services
   * Audit key access regularly

3. **Plan for key rotation**
   * Implement a key rotation strategy and schedule
   * Ensure the application can handle multiple valid keys during rotation periods
   * Maintain old public keys for a period to validate tokens issued before rotation

==== Implementation Example

```java
// Example of configuring multiple keys for rotation
JwksLoader jwksLoader = new CachedJwksLoader(
    new MultiSourceJwksLoader(List.of(
        new HttpJwksLoader("https://idp.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json"),
        new FileSystemJwksLoader("/path/to/backup/jwks.json")
    ))
);
```

=== JWKS Configuration

This section provides guidance on securely configuring JWKS endpoints. For details on how the library protects against JWKS-related vulnerabilities, see link:security-specifications.adoc#jku-x5u-header-abuse[JKU / X5U Header Abuse] and link:security-specifications.adoc#embedded-jwk[Embedded JWK] in the Security Specifications document.

==== Recommendations

1. **Use a secure JWKS endpoint**
   * Ensure JWKS endpoints are available over HTTPS
   * Implement proper caching of JWKS responses
   * Consider having a fallback mechanism for JWKS retrieval

2. **Configure proper JWKS refresh intervals**
   * Set appropriate refresh intervals for JWKS caching
   * Implement automatic retry mechanisms for failed JWKS retrievals
   * Consider using an exponential backoff strategy for retries

3. **Handle key ID (kid) properly**
   * Validate the `kid` claim and use it to select the correct key
   * Implement proper error handling for unknown `kid` values
   * Consider logging unknown `kid` values as potential security events

==== Implementation Example

```java
// Example of configuring JWKS caching
JwksLoader jwksLoader = new CachedJwksLoader(
    new HttpJwksLoader("https://idp.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json"),
    CacheConfiguration.builder()
        .refreshInterval(Duration.ofHours(24))
        .retryInterval(Duration.ofMinutes(5))
        .maxRetries(3)
        .build()
);
```

== Logging and Monitoring Recommendations

=== Security Logging

This section provides guidance on implementing effective security logging. For information on how the library implements security event logging, see link:security-specifications.adoc#security-event-counter[Security Event Counter] in the Security Specifications document.

==== Recommendations

1. **Log security-relevant events**
   * Log all authentication successes and failures
   * Log token validation failures with appropriate error codes
   * Log suspicious activities such as token reuse or replay attempts

2. **Include appropriate context in logs**
   * Include a correlation ID for tracking requests across services
   * Log the token issuer and subject (but never log the full token)
   * Include timestamp and source IP information

3. **Implement proper log protection**
   * Secure access to logs
   * Consider using a centralized logging system
   * Implement log rotation and archiving

==== Implementation Example

```java
// Example of logging a token validation failure
try {
    validator.validateToken(token);
} catch (TokenValidationException e) {
    logger.warn("Token validation failed: {} for subject: {}, issuer: {}, correlationId: {}",
        e.getErrorCode(), e.getSubject(), e.getIssuer(), requestContext.getCorrelationId());
}
```

=== Security Monitoring

==== Recommendations

1. **Implement token-specific monitoring**
   * Monitor for unusual token usage patterns
   * Set up alerts for high rates of token validation failures
   * Monitor for tokens with suspicious claims or headers

2. **Set up alerting for security events**
   * Create alerts for potential attacks or vulnerabilities
   * Configure proper notification channels for security events
   * Implement escalation procedures for critical security alerts

3. **Regularly review security logs**
   * Establish a schedule for security log review
   * Look for patterns that might indicate attacks
   * Consider using log analysis tools for large-scale systems

==== Implementation Example

```java
// Example of configuring metrics for token validation
tokenValidator.setMetricsCollector(metrics -> {
    metrics.registerCounter("token.validation.failures", "Token validation failures");
    metrics.registerHistogram("token.validation.latency", "Token validation latency");
});
```

== Common Misconfigurations to Avoid

=== Security Pitfalls

This section outlines common security pitfalls to avoid. For a comprehensive analysis of JWT vulnerabilities and how they are mitigated in the library, see the link:security-specifications.adoc[Security Specifications] document.

==== Recommendations

1. **Avoid common JWT security mistakes**
   * Never accept unsigned tokens (alg: none)
   * Never skip signature verification
   * Never trust token claims before validation
   * Never use weak keys for HMAC algorithms

2. **Avoid weak configuration**
   * Don't disable claim validation for convenience
   * Don't set overly long token expiration times
   * Don't allow insecure algorithms
   * Don't skip audience or issuer validation

3. **Prevent injection vulnerabilities**
   * Validate and sanitize all user input
   * Don't use token claims directly in database queries
   * Be cautious with dynamic token handling code

==== Anti-patterns to Avoid

```java
// ANTI-PATTERN: Skipping signature verification (NEVER DO THIS)
String[] parts = token.split("\\.");
String payload = new String(Base64.getDecoder().decode(parts[1]));
// Using the payload without verifying the signature

// ANTI-PATTERN: Allowing any algorithm (NEVER DO THIS)
TokenValidator validator = TokenValidator.builder()
    .allowAnyAlgorithm(true) // This is dangerous!
    .build();
```

=== Application Integration Issues

==== Recommendations

1. **Implement proper error handling**
   * Handle token validation errors gracefully
   * Provide meaningful error messages to users
   * Don't expose sensitive details in error responses

2. **Implement proper token renewal**
   * Handle token expiration gracefully
   * Implement automatic token refresh when appropriate
   * Handle refresh token expiration properly

3. **Secure your application beyond tokens**
   * Implement proper input validation
   * Use Content Security Policy to prevent XSS
   * Use proper CORS configuration to prevent unauthorized access

==== Implementation Example

```java
// Example of proper error handling
try {
    ParsedToken parsedToken = validator.validateToken(token);
    // Use the parsed token
} catch (TokenExpiredException e) {
    // Handle expired token - try to refresh
    tryRefreshToken();
} catch (TokenValidationException e) {
    // Handle validation failure - redirect to login
    redirectToLogin("Your session is invalid. Please log in again.");
}
```
