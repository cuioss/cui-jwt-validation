# Token-Sheriff - AI Agent Guidance

Token-Sheriff is a high-performance OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect token validation library for Java/Quarkus applications. This document guides AI coding agents when working with the codebase.

## Dev Environment Tips

### Build System
- **Build tool**: Maven, via the wrapper (`./mvnw`) — never a locally installed `mvn`
- **Java version**: as declared by `maven.compiler.release` in the root `pom.xml`
- **Primary framework**: Quarkus, pinned by `version.quarkus` in the root `pom.xml`

Deliberately no version numbers here: this file is not a source of truth for them and
silently goes stale. Read the root `pom.xml` and `.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties`
when a concrete version matters.

### Build-Configuration Verification

This project inherits its build configuration from `cui-java-parent`, so the `pom.xml` files in this
repository are not the effective configuration. The authoritative resolution command is:

```bash
./mvnw help:effective-pom
```

That bare form is recursive: it walks the whole reactor and emits one effective POM per module,
wrapped in a single `<projects>` element. `.mvn/maven.config` pins only `-T1C`, which sets build
parallelism and does not change that recursion — pass `-N` to restrict the output to the invoked
(root) project. What the resolution does not show is configuration that lives in a profile which is
currently inactive (for example `pre-commit`): it reflects only the profiles active for that
invocation. Activate the profiles and narrow to the module that the claim is actually about:

```bash
./mvnw -Ppre-commit help:effective-pom -pl <module>
```

- **Before agreeing that a mechanism is missing or unconfigured**, read the parent POM chain and the
  effective POM. A repo-scoped search alone proves nothing about inherited configuration: absence
  from this tree is not absence from the build.
- **Before adding a `<repositories>` or `<pluginRepositories>` declaration** — or any element Maven
  merges by id, such as a plugin `<execution>` — walk the parent chain to its root and read the
  effective POM first. Maven keys these elements by `id`: an entry whose id matches an inherited one
  merges into that entry instead of being appended beside it, with the child's values winning field
  by field while fields the child omits stay inherited from the parent. Reusing an id therefore
  partially overrides the inherited entry rather than adding a second channel. Never reuse a
  super-POM reserved id such as `central` for an additive channel.
- **Before believing a build assertion enforces anything, check its phase against the phase of
  every mutating execution it is meant to police.** An assertion must not run after a mutation it
  polices: the mutation would have already normalised the tree, so the assertion inspects its own
  fixture and cannot fail by construction. A green exit code then proves nothing, and a clean tree
  observed afterwards is evidence that the mutation ran — not that the gate enforces anything.
  Resolving the phase is not optional guesswork: **an `<execution>` with no declared `<phase>`
  takes its goal's default phase from the plugin descriptor**, which no POM in this repository
  shows. Read the descriptor (`./mvnw help:describe -Dplugin=<groupId>:<artifactId> -Ddetail`) or
  the plugin's documentation; never assume "no phase" means "not bound". This is exactly how
  `rewrite:run` (descriptor default `process-test-classes`) silently preceded the `verify`-phase
  `rewrite:dryRun` assertion that was supposed to police it.
- **Before adopting an unreleased snapshot version-property pin**, enumerate every artifact that
  property governs — the main jar and every classifier — and verify each one's actual contents from
  the remote repository rather than a possibly-warm `~/.m2`. Compare class counts against the last
  known-good release.

### Project Structure
Multi-module Maven project:
- `token-sheriff-validation/` - The core Token-Sheriff validation library
- `token-sheriff-quarkus-parent/` - Quarkus framework integration
- `benchmarking/` - Performance benchmarking modules
- `bom/` - Bill of Materials for dependency management

### Essential Build Commands
```bash
# Development build
./mvnw clean verify

# Full build with all tests
./mvnw clean install

# Build single module
./mvnw clean install -pl <module-name>

# Run single test
./mvnw test -Dtest=ClassName#methodName
```

### Code Standards
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces (configured in `.editorconfig`)
- **Line endings**: Unix-style (LF)
- **Encoding**: UTF-8
- **Java features**: Use the modern Java features the configured release level allows (records, sealed classes, pattern matching, text blocks)
- **Lombok**: Use `@Builder`, `@Value`, `@NonNull`, `@ToString`, `@EqualsAndHashCode` appropriately

### Logging Standards
This project uses CUI logging standards with Java Util Logging:
- Logger: `de.cuioss.tools.logging.CuiLogger` (private static final LOGGER)
- **Format specifier**: Always use `%s` for parameter substitution (NEVER `{}`, `%.2f`, `%d`)
- **Structured logging**: Use `de.cuioss.tools.logging.LogRecord` for INFO/WARN/ERROR messages
- **LogRecord ranges**: INFO (001-099), WARN (100-199), ERROR (200-299)
- **Documentation**: All log messages must be documented in `doc/LogMessages.adoc`
- **Exception logging**: Exception parameter always comes first

## Testing Instructions

### Testing Framework
- **Primary**: JUnit 5 (Jupiter)
- **Test patterns**: AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- **Coverage requirement**: two independent rules apply, at different granularities and on different lanes. The rule inherited from `cui-java-parent` is `element=BUNDLE` and gates **both** counters — `INSTRUCTION COVEREDRATIO >= 0.80` **and** `BRANCH COVEREDRATIO >= 0.80` — so it counts instructions and branches, never *lines*. It is declared inside the opt-in `coverage` profile, so a plain `./mvnw clean verify` never applies it. In `token-sheriff-client` the five refresh-path classes (`flow.RefreshFlow`, `token.RotationResult`, `token.RefreshTokenFamily`, `lifecycle.RefreshScheduler`, `lifecycle.InMemoryTokenStore`) carry a stricter per-class floor — `BRANCH >= 0.80` **and** `INSTRUCTION >= 0.90` — enforced on the **default** lane, so a plain `./mvnw clean verify` fails on a refresh-path coverage regression. See `doc/client/specification/test-strategy.adoc` § Coverage gates.
- **Coverage check**: `./mvnw clean verify -Pcoverage` for the module-wide bundle rule; the refresh-path per-class gate needs no profile flag and already runs under `./mvnw clean verify`.
- **Signal integrity**: the rules for proving a check discriminates before trusting its verdict — coverage-gate negative controls, measuring from `clean`, no-verdict versus failing-verdict, and asserting identity rather than a proxy property — are stated once in `doc/client/specification/test-strategy.adoc` § Signal integrity, and that section applies to every module in this repository.

### CUI Test Generator
This project has CUI Test Generator dependencies available for test data generation:
- Provides type-safe, consistent test data generation
- Use `@CsvSource` for simple data
- Use `@ValueSource` for single parameter variations
- Use `@MethodSource` for complex parameterization

### Parameterized Tests
Mandatory for 3+ similar test variants. Common annotations:
1. `@CsvSource`
2. `@ValueSource`
3. `@MethodSource`

### Test Execution Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
./mvnw test

# Run integration tests
./mvnw clean verify -Pintegration-tests -pl token-sheriff-quarkus-parent/token-sheriff-quarkus-integration-tests -am

# Run micro-benchmarks
./mvnw clean verify -pl benchmarking/benchmark-core -Pbenchmark

# Run integration benchmarks
./mvnw clean verify -Pbenchmark -pl benchmarking/benchmark-integration-wrk
```

### Pre-Commit Validation

**CRITICAL**: Execute this sequence before ANY commit:

1. **Quality verification**:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw -Ppre-commit clean verify
   ```
   - Fix ALL errors and warnings (mandatory)
   - Address OpenRewrite markers (see section below)
   - This is a **verify gate, not a formatter** — it never rewrites your files. When it reds on a
     formatting or license-header finding, apply the pass explicitly with
     `./mvnw -Ppre-commit license:format rewrite:run`, then re-run the gate.

2. **Final verification**:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```
   - Must complete without errors or warnings
   - All tests must pass

3. **Integration tests**:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean verify -Pintegration-tests -pl token-sheriff-quarkus-parent/token-sheriff-quarkus-integration-tests -am
   ```

Tasks are complete ONLY after all three steps succeed.

### OpenRewrite Markers - Critical Understanding

Pre-commit builds run OpenRewrite recipes that add markers to flag violations.

**Marker pattern**: `/*~~(TODO: INFO needs LogRecord)~~>*/` or `/*~~(TODO: [message])~~>*/`

**What markers indicate**:
Markers indicate ACTUAL BUGS:
- Placeholder/parameter count mismatches: `"value: %s"` with 0 parameters
- Wrong format specifiers: Using `%.2f`, `{:.2f}`, `{}`, `%d` instead of `%s`
- Missing LogRecord definitions for production INFO/WARN/ERROR logs
- Generic Exception usage instead of specific types
- RuntimeException catches that should be specific exceptions

#### Rewrite OUTPUT vs rewrite REQUEST-TO-ACT

A rewrite run produces two categorically different things, and conflating them is how markers end
up committed:

- A rewrite **output** is a transformation the recipe already applied — formatted whitespace,
  ordered imports, a removed unused import. It is finished work, and it is committed as-is.
- A rewrite **request-to-act** is an injected `/*~~(TODO: … Suppress: …)~~>*/` marker. The recipe
  could not fix the code itself, so it is asking a human to act. It is an open work item, never a
  result. Committing it verbatim ships the request instead of the response.

**Worked example.** Four markers were once committed to this repository verbatim — three
`InvalidExceptionUsageRecipe` markers in `token-sheriff-client` and one
`CuiLogRecordPatternRecipe` marker in `BearerTokenProducer`. Each was a request the author left
unanswered. Reading the whole rewritten tree as "the tool's result" is the mistake: the formatting
was a result, the markers were not.

Acting on a request-to-act does not always mean changing the flagged code — sometimes the correct
answer is that the recipe is wrong, and the act is to record that fact in the sanctioned
suppression form (see below).

**Never commit code with markers present.**

#### Handling strategy

Production code violations:
- Fix the actual bug (add missing placeholders, change format to %s)
- Create LogRecord constant for INFO/WARN/ERROR messages
- Replace generic Exception with specific types (IOException, IllegalStateException, etc.)
- Never catch or throw RuntimeException - use specific exception types

Test code violations:
- For diagnostic/performance logging: Add suppression comment at class level:
  ```java
  // cui-rewrite:disable CuiLogRecordPatternRecipe
  // This is a test/utility class that outputs diagnostic information for analysis
  ```
- For exception handling: Replace RuntimeException with AssertionError in test failures
- For format bugs: Fix placeholder mismatches even in tests (change to %s)

#### `InvalidExceptionUsageRecipe`: narrow the catch, do not suppress

Suppression is **not** a valid strategy for `InvalidExceptionUsageRecipe`. The standing remedy is
to narrow the caught exception type against the **throwers the callee actually declares** — except
where the caught failures come from an **open set of SPI implementations that declare no
`throws`**, in which case there is nothing to narrow against and suppression is legitimate.

That carve-out is the rule's single limit, and it is part of the rule rather than a footnote: the
tree already holds its one sanctioned instance at
`token-sheriff-validation/src/main/java/de/cuioss/sheriff/token/validation/pipeline/TokenBuilder.java:143`,
where custom SPI claim mappers are translated into `TokenValidationException`. Everywhere else,
narrow.

Two practical notes from the sites already narrowed:

- Narrow against the **declared** throwers, not against what a test double happens to throw. When a
  test double throws a type the API does not declare, the double is what is wrong.
- Where a `catch` was load-bearing for an invariant — completing a future, releasing a latch —
  make the `finally` block satisfy that invariant unconditionally **before** narrowing the catch.
  Narrowing first opens a window in which an unnamed throwable escapes with the invariant broken.

#### `CuiLogRecordPatternRecipe`: demonstrated false positives are suppressible in production code

The class-level suppression form above is sanctioned in **production** code too, not only in test
and utility classes — but only for a *demonstrated* recipe mis-fire on a call that is already
correct, and only when the suppression is accompanied by a comment recording the specific mis-fire.
The demonstration is required: this sanction is for proven false positives, never for silencing an
inconvenient finding.

**Worked instance.** `BearerTokenProducer` calls
`LOGGER.warn(e, BEARER_TOKEN_VALIDATION_FAILED, e.getMessage(), e.getEventType())`. The recipe
mis-fires on the `warn(Throwable, LogRecord, Object...)` overload, mistaking the leading
`Throwable` for the format argument; the `LogRecord` template carries exactly two matching `%s`
placeholders and the call is correct. The remedy was a class-level
`// cui-rewrite:disable CuiLogRecordPatternRecipe` plus that explanation.

**Corollary: never contort a correct logging call to satisfy a buggy recipe.**

#### `CuiLoggerStandardsRecipe` rewriting `%n` to `%s` is semantic damage

`CuiLoggerStandardsRecipe` misreads the argument-less `%n` line-separator conversion as a value
placeholder and rewrites it to `%s`, adding a format placeholder with no matching argument and
corrupting the format string. This is semantic damage, not cosmetic churn.

The sanctioned remedy is a `// cui-rewrite:disable CuiLoggerStandardsRecipe` at the affected site
with a comment citing the upstream defect `cuioss/cui-open-rewrite#135` — the form both live sites
already use (`JfrVarianceAnalyzer.printSummary()` and `TokenValidatorMetricsTest`). A format string
carrying `%n` must **never** be "fixed" by accepting the rewrite.

#### What is known about suppression placement, and what is not

The failure that produced the narrow-not-suppress rule was observed for a `// cui-rewrite:disable`
comment placed at the **closing-brace / `catch`** position, and only there. Class-level and
method-level suppression of `InvalidExceptionUsageRecipe` were never tested, so they are
**untested, not refuted**. Treat that as a known gap for a future investigation, not as a finding.

Adjacent evidence exists but must not be over-read: this tree relies on **method-level**
suppression of a *different* recipe (`CuiLoggerStandardsRecipe`, at the two `%n` sites), and a
`rewrite:dryRun` against the clean tree confirmed those suppressions do take effect at that
placement. That result speaks to the **placement mechanism** only. It says nothing about whether
`InvalidExceptionUsageRecipe` honours the same placements.

#### `-Ppre-commit` is a non-mutating verify gate

`-Ppre-commit` does not rewrite your files any more, and it fails loud when it would have to.

The profile inherited from `cui-java-parent` binds two mutating executions — `format-license-headers`
(`license:format`, phase `process-sources`) and `rewrite` (`rewrite:run`, no declared phase, so the
descriptor default `process-test-classes`). Both ran *before* the `verify`-phase assertions meant to
police them, so those assertions inspected an already-rewritten tree and could not fail by
construction. The root `pom.xml` now overrides both executions **by id** with `<phase>none</phase>`,
which unbinds them. What remains in `verify` is only the two non-mutating post-conditions:
`license:check` (`assert-license-headers-unchanged`) and `rewrite:dryRun` with
`failOnDryRunResults=true` (`assert-no-rewrite-changes`). If the gate would change a file, the build
fails and names it.

To **apply** the formatting pass the gate no longer performs, run it explicitly:

```bash
./mvnw -Ppre-commit license:format rewrite:run
```

So a red `-Ppre-commit` run is now a genuine signal — and it is a signal the gate has been
demonstrated to produce: for both halves, a deliberate mutation was introduced, the gate exited
non-zero, the mutation was reverted, and the gate exited zero. A red assertion is reporting a real
mutation: fix the source, run the explicit format command above, suppress at the site with a
recorded rationale, or — only when none of those is possible — add an `<exclusions>` entry to the
local `pre-commit` profile in the root `pom.xml`. Never relax the assertions, and never redeclare
`activeRecipes` locally: the parent's recipe list is the single source of truth.
