/**
 * Signals that the authorization server answered the token request with a success status — so it
 * accepted the request, processed the grant, and <em>redeemed</em> whatever credential was presented
 * — but the response body could not be turned into a usable {@code TokenResponse}.
 * <p>
 * The distinction this type carries is security-relevant and cannot be recovered by the caller: a
 * failure raised <em>before</em> the {@code 2xx} — a connection failure, a DNS failure, an
 * SSRF-blocked target, or a non-success HTTP status — leaves the presented credential untouched at
 * the authorization server, while a failure raised <em>after</em> it means the server has already
 * consumed the grant. On the {@code refresh_token} grant specifically the presented refresh token may
 * by then have been rotated and burned server-side, and because no {@code TokenResponse} is ever
 * constructed on this path, whether it was rotated is not computable from the client at all. Callers
 * that must fail closed therefore treat this exception as <strong>presumed redeemed</strong> — see
 * {@link RefreshFlow#classify(Throwable)}, which maps it to
 * {@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#REDEEMED} carrying
 * {@link RefreshRedemption#rotationUnknown()}.
 * <p>
 * "Before the {@code 2xx}" is itself two situations, and only one of them leaves the credential alive:
 * a {@code 4xx} the server attributed to the credential (RFC 6749 §5.2 {@code invalid_grant}) is
 * carried by the sibling {@link CredentialRejectedException} and classified
 * {@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#CREDENTIAL_REJECTED} — nothing was redeemed, so there is no
 * successor, but the credential is dead. Everything else there is
 * {@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#PRE_REDEMPTION}.
 * <p>
 * It extends {@link TransportException} so every existing caller and every documented
 * {@code @throws TransportException} contract keeps holding unchanged; only a caller that needs the
 * pre-/post-redemption distinction catches this narrower type.

// java:S110 — the inheritance depth is inherited wholesale from the library's existing exception
// taxonomy (TransportException and its ancestors); this type adds exactly one level to it.
// The subtype relation is load-bearing for source compatibility: it is what lets the post-redemption
// signal be added without touching a single existing catch block, assertThrows or documented
// @throws. Flattening the hierarchy to satisfy a parent-count heuristic would break consumer catch
// (TransportException) blocks — a public API break this design exists to avoid.
