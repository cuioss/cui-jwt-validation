/**
 * Drives the OAuth 2.0 {@code refresh_token} grant (RFC 6749 §6) with refresh-token rotation.
 * <p>
 * The flow builds the {@code grant_type=refresh_token} request, applies the configured
 * {@link ClientAuthentication} strategy (deliverable 3), exchanges it at the token endpoint through
 * {@link TokenEndpointClient}, and validates the returned access token through the
 * {@link TokenValidationBridge} ({@code CLIENT-15}). It returns only a validated token — a
 * successful HTTP exchange alone is never trusted.
 * <p>
 * When the authorization server issues a new refresh token (rotation, per the OAuth 2.0 Security
 * BCP), the {@link RotationResult} reports the rotated token and flags the rotation; the caller
 * feeds that transition into its {@link de.cuioss.sheriff.token.client.token.RefreshTokenFamily} so
 * a later replay of a superseded token is detected and the family revoked ({@code CLIENT-17}).
 * <p>
 * The flow also reconciles the scope the authorization server granted against the scope this client
 * requested, and reports the outcome on the {@link RotationResult}
 * ({@link RotationResult.ScopeDelta}). This is <strong>anomaly reporting, not compliance
 * enforcement</strong>: RFC 6749 §3.3 permits the server to grant a scope other than the one
 * requested provided it discloses the result, and the resource server remains the enforcement point
 * for an over-broad claim. A broadened grant is therefore accepted and {@code WARN}-logged by
 * default; it is refused with {@link ClientProtocolException} only when the deployment opts in via
 * {@code ClientConfiguration.strictScopeReconciliation}.
 * <p>
 * Both the validation refusal and the strict-posture scope refusal are raised <em>after</em> the token
 * endpoint has answered, and therefore after the authorization server has redeemed and possibly
 * rotated the presented refresh token — as is an unparseable success response, where rotation cannot
 * be determined at all. A caller holding a session cannot tell from the exception type alone whether
 * the token it still has stored is alive or dead, so each of those refusals <em>carries</em> the
 * {@link RefreshRedemption} it was raised under ({@link RedeemedRefreshFailure}), and
 * {@link #classify(Throwable)} reads it back.
 * <p>
 * A failure raised before that point carries no redemption, and {@code classify} splits that region in
 * two rather than collapsing it. Most of it is
 * {@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#PRE_REDEMPTION} — a connection failure, a DNS failure, an
 * SSRF-blocked target, a {@code 5xx} — where the presented token is untouched, which is what keeps a
 * transient network fault from being mistaken for a burned credential. The exception is a {@code 4xx}
 * the authorization server attributed to the credential itself (RFC 6749 §5.2 {@code invalid_grant}),
 * raised as {@link CredentialRejectedException} and classified
 * {@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#CREDENTIAL_REJECTED}: nothing was redeemed and there is no
 * successor, but the credential is dead and no retry will revive it.
 * <p>
 * The signal rides on the exception rather than on a separate observer argument deliberately:
 * {@link #refresh(ProviderMetadata, String)} stays the one overridable entry point on this
 * subclassable type, so a subclass that intercepts, instruments or stubs a refresh stays on the
 * production path instead of silently becoming dead code.
