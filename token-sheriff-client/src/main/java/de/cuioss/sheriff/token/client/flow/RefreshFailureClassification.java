/**
 * What a refused refresh means for the presented refresh token, as
 * {@link RefreshFlow#classify(Throwable)} decides it.
 * <p>
 * The disposition a caller owes a refusal is not derivable from the exception type it caught, because
 * three structurally different situations all surface as "the refresh failed":
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Kind#PRE_REDEMPTION} — the request never reached the point where the authorization
 *       server processed the grant (a connection failure, a DNS failure, an SSRF-blocked target, a
 *       {@code 5xx}, or a {@code 4xx} the server did not attribute to the credential). The presented
 *       token is untouched and still valid: the session must be left alone. Quarantining here would
 *       destroy a working session over a transient network fault.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Kind#CREDENTIAL_REJECTED} — the authorization server looked at the presented refresh
 *       token and declared it invalid (RFC 6749 §5.2 {@code invalid_grant} on a client-error status).
 *       Nothing was redeemed and nothing was rotated, so there is no successor and nothing to revoke —
 *       but the credential is dead and no retry will revive it, so the session must be cleared.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Kind#REDEEMED} — the authorization server answered a success status, and therefore
 *       consumed the grant, before a client-side check refused the result. The presented token may
 *       have been rotated and burned server-side; the carried {@link RefreshRedemption} says what is
 *       known about that, including the {@link RefreshRedemption#rotationUnknown()} state where it is
 *       not computable at all.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The three are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, which is what lets a caller dispatch on
 * {@link #kind()} in a switch with no default arm: a fourth state added later is a compile error at
 * every dispatch site rather than a silent fall-through to the session-preserving default.
 *
 * @param kind       which of the three situations produced the refusal; never {@code null}
 * @param redemption what the authorization server did to the presented refresh token, carried
 *                   <em>only</em> on {@link Kind#REDEEMED}. It is {@code null} on the other two kinds
 *                   because nothing was redeemed there — an absence that means "no redemption
 *                   happened", never "a redemption happened whose state was lost". The canonical
 *                   constructor rejects both disagreeing pairings, so no instance that contradicts its
 *                   own kind is constructible through any entry point
 * @since 1.0
