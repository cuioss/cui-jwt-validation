/**
 * What the authorization server did to the presented refresh token, reported the moment it is known
 * and independently of whether the refresh subsequently succeeds.
 * <p>
 * A {@link de.cuioss.sheriff.token.client.token.RotationResult} is only ever constructed on the
 * success path, so a caller that must fail
 * closed after a <em>post-redemption</em> refusal has no result to inspect. This value is the
 * separate signal: {@link RefreshFlow} resolves it as soon as the token endpoint has answered and
 * carries it on every refusal raised thereafter ({@link RedeemedRefreshFailure}), which
 * {@link RefreshFlow#classify(Throwable)} reads back as
 * {@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#REDEEMED}. Its absence means the request failed
 * <em>before</em> the authorization server processed it, which {@code classify} splits into two: a
 * {@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#PRE_REDEMPTION} failure (connection failure, DNS failure,
 * {@code 5xx}), where the presented refresh token is still valid and the session must not be
 * quarantined; and {@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#CREDENTIAL_REJECTED}, where the server
 * declared the presented token invalid without redeeming it — no redemption state exists because
 * nothing was redeemed, yet the session must still be cleared.
 * <p>
 * Three states are distinguished, and the third is not a variant of the first two:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #rotated(String)} — the server issued a successor; the presented token is burned.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #notRotated()} — the server reused the presented token (RFC 6749 §6 permits omitting
 *       a new one); it is still valid.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #rotationUnknown()} — the server answered {@code 2xx} but the response could not be
 *       parsed, so no successor is known <em>and rotation is not computable even in principle</em>.
 *       This is the fail-closed state: the presented token is treated as burned, but there is no
 *       successor to revoke.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param rotatedRefreshToken the successor the authorization server issued, or {@code null} when it
 *                            did not rotate or when rotation is unknown. Never a fabricated value:
 *                            the canonical constructor <em>rejects</em> a non-{@code null} token on
 *                            the unknown state, so {@code null} there means "no token to revoke", not
 *                            "no rotation happened". When present it is rejected unless non-blank — a
 *                            blank successor is an unusable revocation target
 * @param rotationKnown       whether the response was usable enough to determine rotation at all;
 *                            {@code false} only for {@link #rotationUnknown()}, and the canonical
 *                            constructor enforces that such an instance carries no successor
 * @since 1.0
