/**
 * Implemented by every exception {@link RefreshFlow#refresh(
 * de.cuioss.sheriff.token.client.discovery.ProviderMetadata, String)} raises <em>after</em> the
 * authorization server has answered and therefore after it has redeemed the presented refresh token.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Why the signal rides on the exception.</strong> Several client-side checks run after the
 * {@code 2xx} — access-token validation and the strict scope-reconciliation refusal — and each of them
 * throws before a {@link de.cuioss.sheriff.token.client.token.RotationResult} exists. A caller holding
 * a session therefore cannot read rotation off a result and cannot tell from the exception type alone
 * whether the token it still has stored is alive or dead. Carrying the state on the thrown exception
 * closes that gap without a second, competing entry point into the flow: {@code refresh} stays the one
 * overridable method, so a subclass that intercepts it stays on the production path.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Absence is as meaningful as presence — but it is not one state.</strong> A failure raised
 * <em>before</em> the server processed the request — a connection failure, a DNS failure, an
 * SSRF-blocked target, or a non-success HTTP status — does not implement this interface. That absence
 * is what stops a transient network fault from being mistaken for a burned credential and destroying a
 * working session. It does not, however, mean the presented token is necessarily alive: one shape
 * inside it, a {@code 4xx} whose RFC 6749 §5.2 body names {@code invalid_grant}, is the server
 * declaring this credential dead without ever redeeming it, and is carried by
 * {@link CredentialRejectedException}. Callers must therefore classify through
 * {@link RefreshFlow#classify(Throwable)} rather than by listing exception types, so all three
 * situations — {@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#PRE_REDEMPTION},
 * {@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#CREDENTIAL_REJECTED} and
 * {@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#REDEEMED}, the last of which folds in the
 * unparseable-success case ({@link RedeemedResponseException}) — are decided in one place.
