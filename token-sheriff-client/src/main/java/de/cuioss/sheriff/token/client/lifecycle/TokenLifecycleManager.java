/**
 * Orchestrates the server-side token lifecycle over a {@link TokenStore}: store, retrieve, proactive
 * refresh, and revoke-and-clear on logout ({@code CLIENT-17} / {@code CLIENT-18} / {@code CLIENT-19}).
 * <p>
 * Refresh is sender-constraint aware but proof-driven, not metadata-only: {@link #applyRefresh} takes
 * the {@code cnf} binding actually confirmed on the refreshed token and verifies it against the stored
 * {@link StoredToken#binding() ConstraintBinding} (via {@link StoredToken#refreshed}), so a
 * proactively-refreshed token that came back as a plain bearer — or bound to a different key — is
 * rejected as a downgrade rather than silently keeping the stale binding ({@code CLIENT-18}).
 * <p>
 * <strong>Refresh is identity-bound as well as constraint-bound.</strong> Alongside that downgrade
 * refusal, {@link #applyRefresh} carries the principal the refreshed access token names and
 * {@link StoredToken#refreshed} refuses the refresh when a session already bound to a subject is handed
 * a different one — so a refresh rotates credentials but never re-points a live session at another
 * user. Both checks run inside the same atomic transform, so neither opens a check-then-act window.
 * When the transform refuses a redemption the authorization server already <em>rotated</em>,
 * {@link #doRefresh} fails the session closed: the presented token has been burned at the AS, so
 * there is nothing left to keep using. The AS-issued successor is revoked (RFC 7009), and the store
 * entry and the session's {@link de.cuioss.sheriff.token.client.token.RefreshTokenFamily} are cleared,
 * forcing re-authentication. Restoring the presented token instead would leave the client holding a
 * credential the AS has already invalidated, turning a local refusal into a remote failure on the very
 * next refresh. A refusal on a <em>non-rotated</em> redemption needs none of this: the presented token
 * is still valid at the AS and the family was never advanced, so the untouched store entry stays usable.
 * <p>
 * <strong>The same fail-closed rule covers refusals raised inside the exchange itself.</strong>
 * {@link RefreshFlow#refresh} can refuse after the authorization server has already answered — the
 * freshly issued access token fails client-side validation, the granted scope is broader than
 * requested under the opt-in strict posture, or the successful response cannot be parsed at all — and
 * every one of those reaches {@link #refresh} before any {@link RotationResult} exists, so rotation
 * cannot be read off a result. The discriminator is instead
 * {@link RefreshFlow#classify(Throwable)}, which sorts every refusal into one of three dispositions
 * this class dispatches on with no default arm:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#REDEEMED} — the server consumed the grant. The
 *       carried {@link de.cuioss.sheriff.token.client.flow.RefreshRedemption} says whether the
 *       presented token was burned; when it was, the session is quarantined and the known successor
 *       revoked. An unparseable success response is the one redeemed case where rotation is not
 *       computable at all; it is presumed rotated and cleared, without inventing a successor to
 *       revoke.</li>
 *   <li>{@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#CREDENTIAL_REJECTED} — the server declared the
 *       presented refresh token invalid (RFC 6749 §5.2 {@code invalid_grant}) without redeeming it.
 *       The session is cleared, but no revocation is attempted: there is no successor, and the
 *       presented token is exactly what the server just refused.</li>
 *   <li>{@link RefreshFailureClassification.Kind#PRE_REDEMPTION} — the request never reached
 *       redemption (a connection failure, a DNS failure, a {@code 5xx}), so the presented token is
 *       still valid and the session is deliberately left intact rather than destroyed over a transient
 *       fault.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Logout is fail-closed with no stale-read window.</strong> {@link #revokeAndClear} performs a
 * single atomic take-and-clear via {@link TokenStore#remove(String)}: after it returns, the session's
 * tokens are already gone from the store, so any concurrent {@link #get} sees nothing and a stale
 * token can no longer be used through the store. The returned bundle is handed back so the relying
 * party revokes it at the authorization server (RFC 7009, via
 * {@link RevocationClient}) — the store clear (client-side fail-closed) and the AS revocation
 * (server-side invalidation) together defend {@code T-LOGOUT} / {@code T-REFRESH-THEFT}.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Refresh is reuse-detecting, single-flight, and ID-token-consistent.</strong>
 * {@link #refresh} drives the whole rotation for a session: it presents the stored refresh token
 * through {@link RefreshFlow}, routes the rotation through the session's
 * {@link RefreshTokenFamily}, and on a detected reuse of a superseded token revokes the family at the
 * authorization server (RFC 7009) and clears the store fail-closed ({@code CLIENT-5}). A
 * per-session single-flight collapses a concurrent proactive refresh onto one in-flight rotation, so
 * a benign race never redeems the same token twice and self-classifies as reuse. A refreshed ID token
 * is verified for OIDC Core §12.2 {@code iss}/{@code sub} consistency against the refreshed access
 * token and carried forward, rather than silently preserving the pre-refresh ID token.
 * <p>
 * The session&rarr;family mapping is held in-memory (matching the default {@link InMemoryTokenStore}
 * posture); a relying party that runs a persistent, shared {@link TokenStore} across instances would
 * pair it with a persistent family store — that SPI is not yet provided.
